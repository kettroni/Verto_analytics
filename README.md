"How the program works:
Simply run the HailstoneSequence program and the program will ask you a number.
After the user input the program calculates the amount of steps and the 2nd highest
number from the iterations. Then it will create a HTML file to directory results as
'result.html'. Then you may open it and enjoy the fantastic view of <table>!"
